# Audio_projects

Here, I will post different types of audio projects, such as speech emotion recognition and diarization. Most projects are created either by using the Librosa package or then by downloading existing models.


Projects:

Keyword detection:

In this project I use Valerio Velardo's Youtube lectures to build a keyword detection app. The app uses a convolutional neural network that is trained on a speech command dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands) to predict the number a person says on an audio file. I then used flask to build a non-user friendly app to which you can input an audio file and it predicts the number.
